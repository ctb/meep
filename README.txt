CTB notes on hw4:

  - your twill tests are in the twill directory, which is fine (and
    probably a good idea).  But your twill directory also contains
    *all* of twill.  I would suggest removing all but the tests
    specific to your Web app (I'm not sure about the simplest way to do
    this -- I can show you a 'find' command in class that might work)
